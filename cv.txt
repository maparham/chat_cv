Motivational
I see myself as a natural developer and problem solver with above average capabilities, strong
intuition, good grasp of fundamentals, and a practical sense for code and design smell. I started
programming for a living two decades ago when I was a bachelor student in Tehran while going
through a tough student life. The more professional agile experience started with the Berlin job
(backend Node.js) which was my first time away from home and in Europe. At some point my
passion and respect for theoretical computer science inspired me to do a PhD. It was satisfying
although pragmatically foolish in retrospect. Afterward, I decided to go back to the dev industry
and earn more salary and further practical experience. Passion for genuine science work doesn’t
pay the rent.

What I’m offering?
• strong implementation experties and technical senses
• solid fundation in CS, mathematics, physics, and SE
• flexible adaptive mindset (shockingly rare in Europe)
• diverse techincal backround: from scentific to web developement
• advanced English and technical writing skills
• eager to learn new tools and concepts quickly on demand
• passion for clean and accurate code, and for clean logical design

Expectations
I’d like to work with a flexible, creative, ambitious, respeceful team, ideally a truely international
one with diverse experience. Above all, I value a healthy goal-oriented culture. I need a job that is
mentally engaging. My expected salary starts at 60k. The exact number depends on job details,
office conditions, homeoffice/remote possibility etc.
